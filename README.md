Welcome to the “Summer Champ” ![Website Logo](image.png) website.

You can check out our special sports events to utilize this summer time at its best.


<br /> <hr />
Features:

* You can find our top popular sports classes here & enroll in your favorite one. You can also check out our top instructors who are always ready to excite your sports experience.

<br />

* As a user, after logging in to your dashboard, you can select your favorite class & enroll in it later subject to availability of seats. 

* You can make payment with any “card” directly to enroll in a class. You also have the history page for your payments & class-enrollment.

<br />

* If you are an instructor, You can add a new class. However, it needs to be approved by an admin later on.

<br />

* If you are logged in as an admin, You can view all the classes & you may approve or deny it. You can send a feedback to the concerned instructor if you denied the class approval. 

* You can also find all the registered users on the “manage users ” page. You can make any user to an “Instructor” or an “Admin” here.

<br />

* So, as you can see, here is 3 different user functionality in dashboard & these are: common user or students, instructors & admin.

* You can "log in" by "registering" with an email address & password. You can also log in with your "Google" or "GutHub" authentication.

<br />

* Here, "firebase" is used for authentication & "mongoDB" for database management . It is easy & more user friendly. Anyway, if you face any issues regarding security concerns, you can contact us.

* I have also implemented "@tanstack/react-query" along with "axiosSecure" by using "axios" for extra phase of security.

* Besides these, I have used "stripe/stripe-js" as the payment method for this website.
